- for loop
- recursive pointer indexing   =====TO TEMP======
- cloning static variables... behavior works differently if a value is on the stack
- figure out how to make static variables initialize only once
  - probably keep a list of allocations to not clear on load
- indirect assignment
- wait until X -> repeat while X {}  (unless expression stack is empty, otherwise it compiles directly into wait until)
- ability to report more than one error
- bug: sprite variable ids may overlap with stage variable ids
- optimization: attach argument to custom block instead of saving to stack

- assigning to temp here does not work with structs:
- if expr_stack.stack_size > 0:
        file.write(f"temp = {expr};\n")
        expr_stack.clear(file)
        file.write(macro_set_from_stack_base(write_offset, "temp") + "\n")
    else:
        file.write(macro_set_from_stack_base(write_offset, expr) + "\n")


- structs
- stack arrays
