- for loop
- pointers + memalloc
- wait until X -> repeat while X {}  (unless expression stack is empty, otherwise it compiles directly into wait until)

- assigning to temp here does not work with structs:
- if expr_stack.stack_size > 0:
        file.write(f"temp = {expr};\n")
        expr_stack.clear(file)
        file.write(macro_set_from_stack_base(write_offset, "temp") + "\n")
    else:
        file.write(macro_set_from_stack_base(write_offset, expr) + "\n")
